    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "multipleChoice",
      "prompt": "Variables used to store decimal values, such as 3.75, can be of type float or ______________ ."
      "choices": [
        "double",
        "String",
        "int",
        "None of the above"
      ],
      "correctChoice": "A"
      "explanation": "A type double in Java can store numbers with decimals. An int can only store whole numbers and a String stores words."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "multipleChoice",
      "prompt": "What syntax would you use to initialize an integer?"
      "choices": [
        "int x = 9.5;",
        "int x = 2",
        "int x = 4;",
        "double x = 3.0;"
      ],
      "correctChoice": "C"
      "explanation": "C is correct because a variable with type integer cannot be a decimal and it must have a semi-colon at the end."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "type": "narrative",
      "prompt": "Methods that do NOT return a value have a return type of _____?"
      "correctChoice": "void",
      "explanation": "If a method is void, it means there is no value returned. Like a set-method, you can set something but unless you use a get-method, nothing is returned."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "type": "narrative"
      "prompt": "From the following code, what would the output look like if I printed the variable z? int x = 10; int y = 5; int z = x/y;"
      "correctChoice": "5",
      "explanation": "In this example the variable z is taking two variables, x and y, which have been previously initialized woth values and dividing them. Knowing this, all you need to do is simple arithmetic to get the answer!"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "type": "Which image shows the correct way to initialize an ArrayList?"
      "choices": [
        "incorrectImage.png",
        "correctImage.png"
      ]
      "correctChoice": "B",
      "explanation": "B is the correct answer because in the first picture the person initializes the ArrayList with <String, Integer>, but an arrayList can only use one or the other, not both arguments."
